Flickr_App
==========

Little .Net App with Flickr images
Little App using Flickr .Net dll
 - display most recent images as thumbnailsand allow user to click on any to see them bigger
 - allow filtering based on name/tag
 - allow additional filtering based on lat/long geographical selection based on a radius in miles

Still need to look into:
 - performances (caching images on local webserver)
 - clean up the UI and makes it look more attractive
 - add google map to show the actual pictures location where they were taken


Thanks for looking!
